## **README: Serial Port to WiFi Bridge**

### **Overview**
This C# application serves as a bridge between a serial port and a Wi-Fi network. It reads data from the serial port and broadcasts it over the network, allowing for seamless communication between devices.

### **Prerequisites**
* **Visual Studio:** A compatible version of Visual Studio is required for development and building the application.
* **.NET Framework:** Ensure the necessary .NET Framework version is installed on your system.

### **Installation**
1. **Clone the Repository:** Download the source code from the GitHub repository.
2. **Open in Visual Studio:** Launch Visual Studio and open the project file (`.sln`).
3. **Build the Solution:** Compile the project to generate the executable.

### **Configuration**
* **Serial Port Settings:**
  - **Port Name:** Specify the name of the serial port (e.g., COM3).
  - **Baud Rate:** Set the baud rate (e.g., 9600).
  - **Parity:** Configure parity settings (e.g., None, Odd, Even).
  - **Data Bits:** Specify the number of data bits (e.g., 8).
  - **Stop Bits:** Set the number of stop bits (e.g., 1).
* **Network Settings:**
  - **Broadcast Address:** Define the IP address of the broadcast network.
  - **Port Number:** Choose a unique port number for communication.

### **Usage**
1. **Run the Application:** Execute the compiled executable.
2. **Connect Device:** Connect a device to the specified serial port.
3. **Send Data:** Transmit data from the connected device.
4. **Receive Data:** The application will read the data and broadcast it over the network.

### **Features**
* **Real-time Data Transmission:** Data is sent over the network as it's received from the serial port.
* **Customizable Settings:** Configure serial port and network parameters to match your specific requirements.
* **Reliable Communication:** Implements error handling and retry mechanisms for robust data transfer.

### **Additional Notes**
* **Security:** Consider implementing security measures, such as encryption, to protect sensitive data transmitted over the network.
* **Performance:** Optimize the application for performance, especially when dealing with high data rates or large datasets.
* **Error Handling:** Implement proper error handling to gracefully handle exceptions and provide informative feedback.
